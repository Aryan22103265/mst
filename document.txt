1. High-Level Structure of the Code
Main Entry Point: The main function will likely handle input parsing, setting up data structures, and calling the appropriate MST algorithm based on user input or configuration.

Data Structures: The code will define key data structures to represent graphs (vertices, edges) and auxiliary structures for union-find operations (used in Kruskal's algorithm).

MST Algorithms: Two CUDA-based MST algorithms will be implemented:

Data-Parallel Borůvka's Algorithm (gpuMST)
Data-Parallel Kruskal's Algorithm (gpuMSTdpk)
CPU Baselines: There will be implementations of:

Serial Kruskal's Algorithm
Parallel CPU Kruskal's Algorithm
Utility Functions: The code will include utility functions for tasks like sorting edges, union-find operations, timing, and memory management.

2. Key Functions and Their Roles
Main Function
Initialization:

Parses command-line arguments for graph type, size, and options.
Initializes the graph, allocating memory and setting up initial conditions.
Algorithm Selection:

Depending on the input, selects whether to run gpuMST, gpuMSTdpk, or one of the CPU-based algorithms.
Execution and Timing:

Runs the selected algorithm, measures its execution time, and outputs the results.
Cleanup:

Frees any dynamically allocated memory.
Graph Initialization Functions
Graph Generation:

Functions like generateRandomGraph(), generateGridGraph(), and generatePowerLawGraph() generate graphs of different types.
These functions fill data structures with vertices and edges according to the chosen graph model.
Graph Representation:

Typically, a graph is represented by arrays of edges and vertices. The graph initialization functions prepare these arrays.
Union-Find Structure
Union-Find Operations:
Functions for find() and union() operations with path compression and union by rank.
These are essential for Kruskal’s algorithm to efficiently manage connected components.
MST Algorithms
Borůvka’s Algorithm (gpuMST):

Edge Contraction: Finds the minimum edge for each component and contracts it.
Component Merging: Merges components connected by minimum edges.
Iterative Process: Repeats until only one component remains.
Kruskal’s Algorithm (gpuMSTdpk):

Edge Sorting: Sorts edges based on their weights using a parallel sort (likely using Thrust).
Edge Selection: Selects edges in order and uses union-find to detect cycles, ensuring only MST edges are added.
Parallel Execution on GPU
CUDA Kernels:
Kernels for parallelizing the key steps in Borůvka’s and Kruskal’s algorithms.
For Borůvka’s, kernels would handle finding minimum edges for components and merging components.
For Kruskal’s, kernels might handle edge filtering, union-find operations, and edge selection.
Performance Measurement
Timing Functions:

Functions to record the start and end times of algorithm execution, typically using CUDA events or CPU timers.
Result Reporting:

Functions to report the execution time, memory usage, and correctness of the MST.
3. Documentation Approach
For each function, the documentation should include:

Purpose: A brief description of what the function does.
Parameters: Description of input parameters and expected output.
Algorithm/Logic: Explanation of the core logic, particularly for complex operations like the union-find, sorting, or graph traversal.
CUDA-Specific Considerations: For GPU functions, document any CUDA-specific features, such as memory management (e.g., cudaMalloc, cudaMemcpy), kernel launches, and synchronization.
